# Computational-Astrobiology
MASS - Belgrade S2

This module explores the principles and techniques of Machine Learning, applying them to Astrophysics through a range of projects. Assessment is based on a presentation covering both the tutorial material and project workâ€”both of which are included in this repository.

## Topics covered in the tutorials:

- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Support vector machines
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Principal Component Analysis (Only unsupervised example)
- K nearest neighbours using K-fold Cross Validation
- Feed forward Neural Networks
- Transformers

## Project: Detecting Technosignatures with SOMs & Doppler Drift Search

This project focuses on analyzing real Breakthrough Listen (BL) radio astronomy data, using Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) for signal clustering and TurboSETI for Doppler drift detection. The goal is to precluster signals, extract anomalies, and search for potential technosignatures.
